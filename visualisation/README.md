# Visualisation

The visualisation scripts were used to generate plots for our analysis of the network metrics as well as the benchmarking results of our research.

## Execution

The scripts are not meant to just be executed, but are working files were we regularly changed and adapted code. They cannot be used to generate all plots used in the presenations or the paper at the same time.
